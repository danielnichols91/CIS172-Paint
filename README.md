# CIS172-Paint

Final Project for Object-Oriented Class.

Directions:
Create a fully functional system that allows you to draw similar to Microsoft Paint. The system must be meaningful, complete and include a graphical interface with the user in which the user selects a tool, color and draw with his or her mouse.


The application must allow one to:

Draw circles of different sizes according to how much you drag your mouse.

Draw triangles of different sizes according to how much you drag your mouse.

Draw squares of different sizes according to how much you drag your mouse.

Draw lines of different sizes according to how much you drag your mouse.

Select color for any of the operations above.

Save the image to a BMP, JPG, PNG, or other image format


The following features aware extra points:

Draw with the pencil tool, according to a configurable stroke size. (Extra point)


The system must:

Include at least one point where the operator instanceof is used.

Include at least one instance where Inheritance is adopted.

Include at least one point where polymorphism is used.

Include at least one point where any “composition” (i.e., composition/aggregation and association) is used.

Include at least one point where an exception is thrown.

Include at least one point where an exception is handled and treated.

Objects should be fully encapsulated.

Include at least one abstract class that is extended.

Include at least one interface that is implemented.

Be thoroughly tested and error/exception free. If something is not working, don’t leave it there to the user.

Follow coding guidelines and conventions

Use Java naming convention.

Be consistent in your formatting and indentation.

Don’t use magic numbers (i.e., non-obvious values that aren’t declared as constants or variables – literal numbers)

Include at least one example in which a method is overridden.

Include at least one example in which a method is overloaded.

Include at least 5 test cases, each one for a testing a different method from a class


All these requirements should be fulfilled in a meaningful way. Ask the professor if you are not sure whether what you have is meaningless or not.




Documentation:

You must also create a UML class diagram depicting the main classes composing the system.

Javadoc must be generated for each public method and class of your project.

Include and sign a statement in a sheet of paper that says no code was copied.
